### 4. **Add a License (Optional but Recommended)**

1. In your repository, click **Add file > Create new file**.
2. Name the file `LICENSE`.
3. Choose a license template (e.g., **MIT License**).
4. Click **Commit new file**.

This will clearly define how others can use or contribute to your project.

### 5. **Display Programming Languages and Stats**

GitHub automatically shows the programming languages used in your repository based on the file types you upload. For example:

- `.py` files will display as Python.
- `.pcap` files won't show as code but are still valuable as part of your analysis.
  
If you upload files in different languages like **Python**, **Shell Scripts**, and **Markdown** (`.md`), GitHub will display language statistics automatically on the right-hand side of your repository page.

### 6. **Promote Your Repository**

Once your repository is set up, share it on different platforms:
- **LinkedIn**: Share the link to your repo with a brief description of what it offers.
- **Twitter/X**: Tweet about it, using hashtags like `#IncidentResponse`, `#Forensics`, `#CyberSecurity`.
- **Reddit**: Post in relevant subreddits, such as `r/netsec` or `r/cybersecurity`.

### 7. **Monitor Repository Stats**

- **Stars & Forks**: These metrics indicate how many people have found your repository useful.
- **Clones & Traffic**: GitHub Insights (in the repository settings) can show how many people are viewing your repo.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functioning, well-structured repository showcasing your Incident Response guide. This will help highlight your work and attract recognition in the community.
